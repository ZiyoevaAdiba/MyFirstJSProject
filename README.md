# MyFirstJSProject

Hello!

This is calculator!

It is my first Project on the Javascript(also HTML, CSS), so please go easy on me üôà

Pros:
1. Operators can not be entered one after another 
2. You can see the equation u give to the calculator also when u get the answer

My solution has drawbacks.These are:
1. '.' can be entered several times eventhough it can not be entered one after another.
2. Operators can be entered in the beginning of my equation

Plans: I'll work on my drawbacks and update it soon ! (if anyone wants)

Here is how it looks like: 
1. when nothing is entered:

2. when equation is entered:

3. when equal sign is entered:
first raw is equation
second is the result of calculation
